# NFC Tag Identifier

This class and sample app tries to identify an NFC tag tapped to the NFC-reader and retrieves some useful 
information about the tag, e.g. exact Tag type and available extra functionalities.

**This is an unfinished project at the moment and only and a handful tags are included, please wait for updates.**

**Note:** as I'm possessing only some of the tags checked with this class you find an extra boolean field "isTested" - 
this is TRUE if I could test the function with a real NFC tag of this type.

For all NFC-tags checked within this class you find the datasheets in the docs-folder of this repository and below 
there are the links to the newest datasheets - please use always the origin source instead of the preloaded 
ones.
