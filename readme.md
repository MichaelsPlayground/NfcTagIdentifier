# NFC Tag Identifier

This class and sample app tries to identify an NFC tag tapped to the NFC-reader and retrieves some useful 
information about the tag, e.g. exact Tag type and available extra functionalities.

**This is an unfinished project at the moment and only and a handful tags are included, please wait for updates.**

For all NFC-tags checked within this class you find the datasheets in the docs-folder of this repository and below 
there are the links to the newest datasheets - please use always the origin source instead of the preloaded 
ones.
